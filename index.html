        <p> Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March
            1935),
            also known as Michael I.</p>
        <img src="pupin.jpg" alt="prima photo" width="150px">
        <p> Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist.</p>

        <p>Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of
            long-distance
            telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
            wire (known as "pupinization").</p>

        <p>Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which
            later
            became NASA.</p>
        <h3 id="early_life"> Early life and education</h3>
        <b> Early life </b>
        <p> Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day
            municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire.</p>
        <p> He always remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor
            (1925): “My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood
            gatherings, you must provide yourself with another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is
            so
            much wonderful knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write.
            Knowledge
            is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path
            through
            this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”</p>

        <p> Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and later to German
            elementary
            school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the
            best
            students there; a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to
            give
            Pupin a scholarship.</p>
        <p> Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many problems with
            Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. In 1872, he went to Prague, where he
            continued
            the sixth and first half of the seventh year.</p>
        <p> After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague
            due to
            financial problems and to move to the United States.</p>

        <p> “When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought
            five
            hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land
            would
            have been the same.</p>
        <p> A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money which he has
            brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned out
            to
            be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, it
            would
            have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, but the struggle which awaited me would
            have been the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a
            handicap to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the
            stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”</p>

        <img src="university.jpg" alt="poza univ" width="250px">

        <p> For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual la borer (most notably at the biscuit
            factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private
            lectures.</p>
        <p> After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered
            Columbia College, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's predicted
            that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman.
        </p>
        <p> A popular student, he was elected president of his class in his Junior year.He graduated with honors in 1883
            and
            became an American citizen at the same time.</p>
        <p> He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to
            Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of
            Electrical
            Engineering.</p>
        <p> Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis.</p>
        <p> Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of physics and
            mathematics, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom
            (1883–1885),
            where he continued his schooling at the University of Cambridge.</p>
        <p> He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the
            United
            States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper,
            insulators,
            and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself.</p>
        <p> Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied
            gases, he
            made successful images on January 2, 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic
            screen
            which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few
            minutes.</p>

        <p> Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary
            X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p> He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York
            surgeon,
            Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove
            lead
            shot from a shotgun injury.</p>
        <p> The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to
            be
            stood still nearly an hour" which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt,
            the
            Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen.</p>
        <p> X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the
            photographic
            plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if
            "drawn
            with pen and ink".</p>
        <p> Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.</p>

        <p> Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering
            work
            of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven
            years.
        </p>
        <p> The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American
            Telephone &
            Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.<br>
            Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development
            in
            hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. </p>

        <h3 id="literarry_work"> Literarry work</h3>
        <p> Besides his patents he published several dozen scientific disputes, articles, reviews and a 396-page
            autobiography under the name Michael Pupin, From Immigrant to Inventor (Scribner's, 1923).</p>
        <p> He won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. It was published in Serbian in 1929 under
            the
            title From pastures to scientist (Od pašnjaka do naučenjaka).</p>
        <p> Beside this he also published:</p>
