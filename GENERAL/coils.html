    <p> Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering
        work
        of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven
        years.
    </p>
    <p> The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American
        Telephone &
        Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy.<br>
        Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development
        in
        hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. </p>
